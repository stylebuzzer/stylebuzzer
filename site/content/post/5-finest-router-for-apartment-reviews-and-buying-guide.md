This will provide you with the best from your router. Given below are some things to keep in mind to find the best place for router.

The first thing to remember is that the router ought to be placed in the middle of the house instead of in a room. This will distribute the network in all directions up to its highest capacity. This is a powerful system to avoid dead spots on your apartment.
It should not be kept hidden on a shelf or under the table. We frequently do that because most routers appear ugly, and customers need them from their sight. But one should keep it behind substantial obstacles as materials like metal, wood, brick block the sign. Therefore, keep it out in an open space.
Additionally, there shouldn't be a microwave close to the router since it will interfere with the system. If your router has adjustable external antennas, then you have the advantage of fixing them towards the device in which you need the most bandwidth. If you maintain the router at a place with keeping the above points in your mind, you can optimize your router's performance.
Now you've read the reviews of the 5 best wireless router for apartment, you'll have an idea about what are the various features of a router. However, how do you determine what attributes are most vital to possess? This is when the purchasing guide comes into the picture.

Coverage or scope of this router is one of the essential facets. Ensure that the assortment of the router is sufficient as per the size of your flat. If it is inadequate, it will lead to dead spots, which refer to the places where the router cannot reach.

Also, purchasing a router with a range that is too wide is just going to improve the price and will probably be of no use.

3. MU-MIMO Technology

This is a technology that's a must-have at a router. Owing to MU-MIMO, all the consumers connected to the wifi can enjoy a fast speed network. Earlier, with SU-MIMO, this wasn't possible. SU-MIMO isn't capable of supplying a secure community to more than 1 user.

We now have many devices in our houses to connect like cellular phones, notebooks, computers etc.. On the other hand, when MU-MIMO came together, this problem has been solved. Therefore, it has to be on your router.

4. Number of Devices That May Be Connected

It is not as you can join any number of devices to your router that you want. Every router can connect just a restricted number of devices. Expensive routers can connect more than fifty devices.

But you should only choose the one that has just a few more capacity than you require to ensure if in the future you've got a new smart device to connect to, you would not have to buy a new router. Also, features such as ethernet ports and USB ports can allow you to connect devices through wires.

5. Security Protocols

There is constant data transfer happening in the community. If the system isn't protected, then there is a threat to the privacy of the user. Your network will be more likely to viruses and data theft.

Hence, sturdy security protocols are important. These attributes work together to make the system safer.

6. Cost

We often think that an expensive router is always going to be the best. However, that is not the situation. Many routers are just overpriced and don't provide many capabilities. This doesn't apply to all expensive routers, but it's true for a few.

Thus, the best way to discover a modem worthy of its price is by proper research. Compare different brands offering the features that you demand in your router. Take the support of the reviews to find whether the router is truly worthy of its cost or not. This will help you find a router in the best cost possible.possible.
